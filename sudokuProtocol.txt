Testing with Different Sudokus

We define difficulty based on the number of pre-filled clues (known values in the 9×9 grid):

Difficulty  Clues Description

Easy        ≥ 36  Mostly filled, direct logic

Medium      28–35 Balanced mix of logic and trial

Hard        ≤ 27  Requires deeper recursion and pruning

Extreme     ≤ 20  More complex grid, significant branching
